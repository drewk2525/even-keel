# Even Keel

This is the start of a project to help rowing coaches track athlete workouts, performance, etc.  This project utilizes the following stack:

- MariaDB
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Vue.js

Flask and SQLAlchemy are used to serve up an API while Vue.js handles the view and front end functionality.
